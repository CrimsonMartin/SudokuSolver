This project is a client-server sudoku solver.

The client parses a sudoku puzzle from txt file called
puzzle1.txt, writes it to a buffer, and sends the buffer
to a server. The server then reads the puzzle, and using
a multithreaded recursive backtracking algorithm, solves
the puzzle and sends the solved puzzle back to the client.
The client then prints the board that it sent and the baord
it received.
